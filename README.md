# LogParser
Parsing error.php from Joomla - Read all records and output an array of unique combinations based on IP Address & error message. Second array holds the number of times a particular combination has appeared.

To-do:
1. Combine both sets in the output to give record & count side-by-side
2. Currently capturing date & time, add "last date/time" to the output.
3. Output somewhere other than console (either CSV file or email.)
